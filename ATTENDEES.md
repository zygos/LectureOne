*Instructions:* Fork this repository and add your name/github username to below the &quot;List of Attendees&quot; header. Then send a pull request; if you see your name at [the master copy](https://github.com/UoLCompSoc/LectureOne/blob/master/ATTENDEES.md) then you&apos;re all set to use git/github on your own projects! Do note that pull requests will require me to accept the changes, so don&apos;t be shocked if your name doesn&apos;t appear immediately.
